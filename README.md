# Diabetes-Prediction
This project utilises the Diabetes dataset from Kaggle and makes a model to predict wether the given person has diabetes or not.
Model.py uses SVM Classifier as our model.
All the columns were numeric.
I saved the model in trained_model.sav pickle file using pickle libraray.
Accuracy is 77%.
Tried other models as well but the accuracy was decreasing.
app.py contains the code for frontend which is made using streamlit.
UI is normal.
